## **üéØ CORE MESSAGE**

This e-book addresses the epidemic of male exhaustion that nobody talks about. It's not about being busy or stressed - it's about the mental energy drain of constantly calculating how to be instead of just being. We'll tackle the root causes: performance anxiety, people pleasing, and the exhausting cycle of thinking about how to act instead of acting authentically.
