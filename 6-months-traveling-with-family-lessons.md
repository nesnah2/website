# 6 MONTHS TRAVELING WITH BABY TWINS + 2 KIDS: What I Learned About Being a Real Man

*Raw lessons from a father who discovered his default mode while living in 200 square feet with 4 kids*

---

## THE TRUTH YOU NEED TO HEAR

**Listen up, men.**

I just spent 6 months traveling with my wife, 4-year-old, 8-year-old, and twin babies.

We lived in tiny spaces. Slept in one room. Shared everything. Had nowhere to hide.

And I discovered something that changed everything:

**I was still operating from my default mode.**

The same patterns that kept me stuck in my comfortable life were running the show in our cramped RV, in foreign countries, with crying babies at 3 AM.

**The puppet master doesn't take vacations.**

---

## WHAT IS THE DEFAULT MODE?

Your default mode is that automatic mindset that runs your life without you realizing it. It's built from your past - your upbringing, experiences, fears.

It whispers: "I'm not enough," "I have to prove myself," "I must stay in control to be safe."

**It was created to protect you, but it traps you instead.**

And here's the brutal truth: **It doesn't disappear when you change your circumstances.**

I thought traveling would fix me. It didn't. It just showed me who I really was.

## 14 RAW LESSONS FROM THE ROAD

### 1. **THERE WERE MOMENTS I WAS SCARED**

**The Truth:** Glimpses of desperation. Whispers of "what the fuck are you doing on a mountain, boat or in the jungle with babies."

**The Wake-Up:** Standing on a remote mountain trail with twin babies strapped to my chest, wondering if I'd made the biggest mistake of my life.

**The Fix:** I learned to sit with the fear instead of running from it. The fear was real, but so was my capability to handle whatever came next.

---

### 2. **TEAMWORK IS EVERYTHING**

**The Truth:** Even when we were tired of each other, we had to work together. No time for resentment or arguing.

**The Wake-Up:** In a cramped van in the middle of nowhere, realizing that our survival literally depended on our ability to function as a team.

**The Fix:** I stopped trying to be right and started trying to be effective. We learned to communicate under pressure, to support each other when we were both exhausted.

---

### 3. **SEEING MY KIDS GROW IN A PATIENT AND EXCITING ENVIRONMENT**

**The Truth:** Watching my kids grow in a patient and exciting environment was everything I ever dreamed about.

**The Wake-Up:** Watching my 4-year-old learn to swim in crystal clear waters, my 8-year-old navigate foreign cities, the twins taking their first steps on different continents.

**The Fix:** I stopped rushing them and started witnessing them. Their growth became my greatest joy, not my greatest stress.

---

### 4. **FRIENDS COME AND GO**

**The Truth:** Teaching my kids and myself that friends come and go. Even though you connected on a deep level with others, you may never meet them again.

**The Wake-Up:** Saying goodbye to families we'd bonded with over weeks, knowing we'd probably never see them again.

**The Fix:** I learned to love deeply and let go gracefully. To appreciate connection without clinging to it.

---

### 5. **THE POWER OF PATIENCE**

**The Truth:** Nothing can fuck me up more than fast decisions made in hurry or desperation. Keep calm and trust the process.

**The Wake-Up:** Almost making terrible decisions about money, travel routes, and accommodations because I was panicking.

**The Fix:** I learned to pause before deciding. To breathe before reacting. To trust that clarity comes with patience.

---

### 6. **MY DEFAULT MODE IS WAY MORE DEVELOPED THAN I TELL MYSELF**

**The Truth:** My default mode is way more developed than I tell myself.

**The Wake-Up:** Realizing that even in paradise, my old patterns were running the show. The same avoidance, the same need for control, the same fear of inadequacy.

**The Fix:** I stopped pretending I was "fixed" and started doing the real work of awareness every day.

---

### 7. **SPEND THE TIME WISELY**

**The Truth:** Don't go to bed angry, finish the planning or task right away.

**The Wake-Up:** Going to bed angry in a tiny space meant everyone suffered. Unfinished tasks meant chaos the next day.

**The Fix:** I learned to resolve conflicts before sleep. To finish what I started. To prioritize peace over being right.

---

### 8. **THE WORLD IS DESPERATE FOR HELP**

**The Truth:** I met men, all ages, from different countries. Most of them confused and restless by default. Just like I was once.

**The Wake-Up:** Sitting in cafes and hostels, listening to men from all over the world share the same struggles I'd had.

**The Fix:** I realized I wasn't alone in my confusion. And I realized I had something to offer - the awareness I'd gained about my own patterns.

---

### 9. **THE DEFAULT MODE WILL HUNT YOU DOWN**

**The Truth:** No matter how many palm trees you are surrounded by, the whispers of the default will hunt you down and destroy the beauty. If you let it.

**The Wake-Up:** Standing on a perfect beach, watching a perfect sunset, and still feeling empty and restless inside.

**The Fix:** I learned that external beauty can't fix internal patterns. The work has to happen inside, regardless of the scenery.

---

### 10. **LOVE IS EVERYWHERE**

**The Truth:** There is a growing interest in true responsibility for own wellbeing. Homeschooling and spiritual inventory was on the rise.

**The Wake-Up:** Meeting families who were choosing different paths - homeschooling, conscious parenting, spiritual growth.

**The Fix:** I realized we weren't alone in wanting something different. There's a movement of people choosing awareness over autopilot.

---

### 11. **MY WIFE IS AN ABSOLUTE WARRIOR**

**The Truth:** Even in the most crazy times, we gathered for planning. No sleep, pissing rain, no clothes. She was ready.

**The Wake-Up:** Watching my wife handle crisis after crisis with grace and strength, while I was falling apart.

**The Fix:** I learned to appreciate her strength instead of feeling threatened by it. To support her instead of competing with her.

---

### 12. **NOTHING CAN BUY THE FREEDOM PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING FOR**

**The Truth:** Nothing in the world can buy the freedom the majority are searching for. It has to be a recreation of the default mode.

**The Wake-Up:** Meeting wealthy people who were still trapped in their patterns, and poor people who had found freedom.

**The Fix:** I realized that freedom isn't about circumstances. It's about consciousness. It's about breaking free from your default mode.

---

### 13. **I NEVER MET ANY BAD PEOPLE**

**The Truth:** I never met any bad people or negativity. Only when I was looking for it.

**The Wake-Up:** Realizing that my experience of the world was shaped by what I was looking for.

**The Fix:** I learned to look for the good in people. To assume positive intent. To create the experience I wanted to have.

---

### 14. **I DON'T NEED TO ESCAPE MY REALITY**

**The Truth:** I don't need to escape my reality, like I did with drugs and emotional self-destruction once.

**The Wake-Up:** Realizing that the most beautiful places in the world couldn't give me what I was really looking for - peace with myself.

**The Fix:** I learned that the escape I was looking for wasn't geographical. It was internal. It was about breaking free from my default mode.

---

### 15. **YOU NEED TO SHOW UP EVERY DAY**

**The Truth:** You need to show up EVERY DAY no matter feelings or emotions. That is the curse and the blessing of being a man.

**The Wake-Up:** Waking up exhausted, scared, or defeated, but knowing my family needed me to be present regardless.

**The Fix:** I learned that being a man means showing up even when you don't feel like it. Your feelings don't get to determine your character.

---

### 16. **LIFE STILL DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PLANS**

**The Truth:** Life STILL doesn't care about your plans. You have to adapt and pivot many times.

**The Wake-Up:** Our carefully planned route through Europe turned into chaos when borders closed, flights were cancelled, and babies got sick.

**The Fix:** I learned to hold plans loosely and hold purpose tightly. Plans change, but purpose remains.

---

### 17. **OTHER PEOPLE WILL CALL YOU BRAVE**

**The Truth:** Other people will call you brave, but you're just living from purpose.

**The Wake-Up:** People telling us how "brave" we were for traveling with kids, when we were just following what felt right.

**The Fix:** I realized that what looks brave to others is just living aligned with your values. Courage isn't the absence of fear - it's acting despite it.

---

### 18. **THE IMPORTANCE OF IMMEDIATE APOLOGY**

**The Truth:** The importance of immediately apology saves days of toxic environment.

**The Wake-Up:** Learning that in close quarters, unresolved conflict poisons everything. A quick "I'm sorry" could save the whole day.

**The Fix:** I learned to apologize immediately when I was wrong, without making excuses or waiting for the "right moment."

---

### 19. **LEARN YOUR KIDS HOW TO FAIL**

**The Truth:** Learn your kids how to fail. And fail. And fail. And fail. And then let them fail again. Chess and muay thai was the secret.

**The Wake-Up:** Watching my kids learn chess and muay thai - sports where failure is constant and necessary for growth.

**The Fix:** I stopped protecting them from failure and started teaching them how to fail well. How to get back up. How to learn from mistakes.

---

### 20. **I AM JUST MIKKEL**

**The Truth:** I am just Mikkel. An ex-criminal drug abuser from the suburbs insisting on living my dreams and spreading hope to the hopeless.

**The Wake-Up:** Realizing that my past doesn't define my future, but it does inform my purpose.

**The Fix:** I stopped hiding from my story and started using it. If I can break free from my default mode, anyone can.

---

## WHAT A FUCKING TRIP

**The most painful realization?**

I spent 6 months traveling the world with my family, and I was still the same man I was when we left.

**But here's what changed:**

I became aware of who I really was.

I saw my patterns clearly.

I stopped pretending I was someone I wasn't.

**And that awareness? That's where transformation begins.**

---

## THE WORKBOOK IS COMING

**Soon I launch my free workbook. It will be about the default mode. Phase 1 & 2.**

**It will show you:**

✅ **Clear awareness** of your default mode patterns
✅ **Understanding** of your escape routes  
✅ **Recognition** of your automatic reactions
✅ **Insight** into what you're really protecting
✅ **Vision** of who you could be without the default mode

**I am excited as fuck, and if you are a man in despair you should be too.**

---

## THE DAILY WORK

**Every day, I ask myself:**

- Am I acting from my default mode or from conscious choice?
- What am I trying to escape from right now?
- What would it look like to stay present with this feeling?
- Who am I when I'm not performing?

**Some days I choose awareness. Some days I don't.**

**But every day I get to choose.**

---

## THE TRUTH

**You're not broken. You're not defective. You're not beyond hope.**

**You're just stuck in patterns that were taught to you.**

**Patterns that made sense when you were a kid trying to survive.**

**But patterns that are now keeping you from thriving.**

**The good news?**

**Patterns can be broken. Habits can be changed.**

**You can learn to be the man you're meant to be.**

**It won't be easy. It will require courage, honesty, and a willingness to face uncomfortable truths about yourself.**

**But it will be worth it.**

**Because on the other side of this work is the man you've always wanted to be.**

**The man who doesn't need permission to exist.**

**The man who creates his own reality.**

**The man who finally stops living on autopilot and starts living consciously.**

**The man who breaks free from his default mode.**

---

## THE QUESTION

**Are you ready to do the real work?**

**Are you ready to stop protecting your own hostage-taker?**

**Are you ready to become the man you're meant to be?**

**The choice is yours.**

**Every moment.**

**Every day.**

**Choose awareness.**

**Choose freedom.**

**Choose to be the man your family needs you to be.**

---

**Thank you for this time Asia. See you soon.**

**Stop protecting your own hostage-taker.**
