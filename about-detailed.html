                <h2>This Is My Story</h2>
                <p>I know what it's like to feel completely broken. To wake up every morning hating yourself. To feel like you're living someone else's life.</p>

                <h3>Growing Up in Fear</h3>
                <p>My father was an alcoholic who terrorized our home. I learned to walk on eggshells, never feeling safe in my own house. This shaped everything about how I saw myself and the world.</p>

                <h3>14 Years of Running</h3>
                <p>From 14 to 28, I used drugs to escape. Anything to numb the pain, to not feel the brokenness inside. I was running from myself, but I couldn't outrun the truth.</p>

                <h3>Cancer Hit Me Twice</h3>
                <p>Life forced me to face reality. Twice. Each diagnosis was a wake-up call that I couldn't keep destroying myself. I had to choose: die or change.</p>

                <h3>Confident & At Peace</h3>
                <p>Now I'm confident, in peace, and aiming to be a better person every day. I'm not afraid to be egotistic in order to keep my peace. I've earned this confidence through my journey.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>I Know These Struggles Because I Lived Them</h2>
                
                <h3>Feeling Like a Fraud</h3>
                <p>That constant voice telling you you're not enough, that you're faking it, that everyone will find out you're a fraud.</p>

                <h3>Lonely in a Crowd</h3>
                <p>Surrounded by people but feeling completely alone. Like you're watching life happen through a window, never really part of it.</p>

                <h3>Addiction & Numbing</h3>
                <p>Using anything to escape - drugs, alcohol, work, porn, food, gaming. Anything to not feel the pain inside.</p>

                <h3>Feeling Fundamentally Broken</h3>
                <p>That deep sense that there's something wrong with you at your core. That you don't belong anywhere, that you're defective.</p>

                <h3>Anger & Rage</h3>
                <p>Feeling angry all the time, but not knowing why. Lashing out at people you love, then hating yourself for it.</p>

                <h3>Can't Sleep, Can't Rest</h3>
                <p>Your mind never stops racing. You're exhausted but can't sleep. Always on edge, always waiting for the next thing to go wrong.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How I Work With Men</h2>
                <p>I don't give you answers. I ask the questions that help you find your own truth. Because real transformation only happens when you discover it yourself.</p>

                <h3>Truth First, Always</h3>
                <p>We start with brutal honesty about where you actually are. No sugar-coating, no pretending. Real growth only happens from truth.</p>

                <h3>Vulnerability is Strength</h3>
                <p>It's not weak to admit you're struggling. It's not weak to ask for help. Real men are honest about their pain.</p>

                <h3>No Judgment Zone</h3>
                <p>I've been where you are. I've done the things you're ashamed of. You can tell me anything without fear of judgment.</p>

                <h3>Action Over Theory</h3>
                <p>We don't just talk about change. We make it happen. Every session ends with concrete steps you'll take before we meet again.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>What You Can Expect Working With Me</h2>
                
                <h3>Safe Space</h3>
                <p>A judgment-free zone where you can be completely honest about your struggles, fears, and failures.</p>

                <h3>Clear Direction</h3>
                <p>Specific, actionable steps to take between sessions. No vague advice - just clear direction on what to do next.</p>

                <h3>Real Support</h3>
                <p>I'm not just your coach during sessions. I'm here when you need me. Real support, not just scheduled meetings.</p>

                <h3>I Will Hold You Accountable</h3>
                <p>I will not watch you make destructive mistakes over and over again. I'll call you out when you're sabotaging yourself.</p>

                <h3>I Will Walk Side by Side</h3>
                <p>I will share my own experience with growing as a man. This isn't theory - it's real life experience from someone who's been there.</p>

                <h3>I Will Watch You Grow</h3>
                <p>I will walk with you side by side as you transform. I'm invested in your success, not just a paid consultant.</p>

                <h2>Ready to Stop Living in the Shadows?</h2>
                <p>If my story resonates with you, if you're tired of feeling broken and alone, let's talk. Real transformation is possible. I'm living proof.</p>
