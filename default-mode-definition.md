# Default Mode Definition

## Core Concept

**Defending unconscious core beliefs creates automatic behaviors = default mode**

## What This Means

- **Unconscious Core Beliefs**: The deep, often unexamined assumptions we hold about ourselves, others, and the world
- **Automatic Behaviors**: The knee-jerk reactions, patterns, and responses that happen without conscious thought
- **Default Mode**: The operating system that runs in the background, driving our actions when we're not paying attention

## The Problem

These automatic behaviors are damaging. They make men:
- Get lost in anger and resentment
- Become confused and questioning
- React out of fear instead of choice
- Sabotage their own growth and relationships

## The Solution

The workbook bridges from awareness to freedom by:
1. **Awareness**: Identifying the unconscious beliefs driving default behaviors
2. **Examination**: Questioning and challenging these core beliefs
3. **New Default**: Creating conscious, intentional responses instead of automatic reactions

## Key Insight

The default mode isn't just habits - it's an entire operating system built on unconscious beliefs that were formed to protect us but now limit us.
