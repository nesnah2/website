# WORKBOOK LAUNCH CONTENT PLAN
*Building Awareness & Curiosity for "Breaking Free From Your Default Mode"*

**Launch Date: October 10th**
**Goal: Create awareness and curiosity around the default mode concept for men in denial**

---

## CORE MESSAGING STRATEGY

### The Problem We're Solving
Men are stuck in automatic patterns they don't even recognize. They're living on autopilot, controlled by beliefs and behaviors they didn't choose but can't seem to change.

### The Solution We're Offering
A workbook that helps men identify, observe, and break free from their "default mode" - the unconscious programming that's been running their lives.

### The Hook for Men in Denial
"You already know what's holding you back. You just don't want to look at it."

## DAILY CONTENT EXAMPLES

### WEEK 1 EXAMPLES

**Day 1: "The moment you realize you've been lying to yourself"**
```
You know that feeling when you catch yourself doing something and think, "Why did I just do that?"

That's your default mode taking over.

You didn't choose to react that way. You didn't decide to get defensive, to shut down, to overthink, to control.

It just happened. Like a program running in the background.

Most men think they're conscious, aware, in control of their choices.

But they're not.

They're living on autopilot, controlled by patterns they don't even recognize.

The question is: are you ready to wake up?

#DefaultMode #MensWork #SelfAwareness
```

**Day 2: "Why smart men make stupid decisions"**
```
Smart men make stupid decisions all the time.

Not because they're not smart enough to know better.

But because their default mode overrides their intelligence.

You can know exactly what you should do, what the right choice is, what would serve you best.

And then watch yourself do the opposite.

Because your default mode doesn't care about logic or reason.

It cares about safety, control, and avoiding discomfort.

Even when that safety is actually dangerous.

Even when that control is actually limiting.

Even when that comfort is actually painful.

Your default mode will choose familiar pain over unfamiliar growth every time.

The question is: will you?

#DefaultMode #MensWork #SelfAwareness
```

### WEEK 2 EXAMPLES

**Day 8: "The puppet master in your mind (and how to spot it)"**
```
There's a puppet master in your mind.

It's been pulling your strings for years.

You don't even know it's there.

But it's the voice that says:
- "I'm not enough"
- "I have to prove myself"
- "I must stay in control"
- "I can't trust anyone"
- "I have to be perfect"

It's the voice that makes you:
- Get defensive when criticized
- Shut down when vulnerable
- Overthink when uncertain
- Control when afraid
- Perform when insecure

It's not you. It's your default mode.

A hardwired belief system built from your past experiences.

Created to protect you, but now trapping you.

The first step to freedom is recognizing it.

The second step is stopping it.

Are you ready to see what's really running your life?

#DefaultMode #MensWork #SelfAwareness
```

### WEEK 3 EXAMPLES

**Day 15: "Why you defend the patterns that are killing you"**
```
You defend the very patterns that are destroying you.

You'll argue for your limitations.

You'll justify your self-sabotage.

You'll rationalize your avoidance.

You'll protect your default mode like it's your best friend.

But it's not your friend.

It's your hostage-taker.

And you're protecting your own hostage-taker.

You'll hurt yourself, hurt others, break your own heart, just to stay loyal to the scripts it feeds you.

You're addicted to this story, even when it suffocates you.

Because the familiar pain feels safer than the unfamiliar growth.

Because the known misery feels more comfortable than the unknown possibility.

Because staying stuck feels more secure than risking change.

But here's the truth:

You're not protecting yourself.

You're protecting your prison.

And the key to freedom is right in your hand.

You just have to stop defending the thing that's keeping you locked up.

Are you ready to stop protecting your own hostage-taker?

```

### WEEK 4 EXAMPLES

**Day 22: "The workbook that most men won't finish"**
```
Most men won't finish this workbook.

They'll download it, skim it, and go back to their comfortable lies.

Because this workbook is not for everyone.

It's for men ready to do the real work.

Men who are tired of living on autopilot.

Men who want to be the man they're meant to be.

Men who are ready to face uncomfortable truths about themselves.

This is not a feel-good workbook.

This is self-confrontation. Raw, ugly, uncomfortable truth.

The courage you got to start this journey is required. No more excuses.

The workbook is coming October 10th.

Are you ready to do the real work?

## FINAL NOTES

This content plan is designed to:
1. **Build awareness** of the default mode concept
2. **Create curiosity** about the workbook
3. **Make men in denial** see themselves in the content
4. **Generate anticipation** for the launch
5. **Drive downloads** on launch day

The key is to be authentic, direct, and unapologetic about the truth. Men in denial need to see themselves in the content without feeling attacked. They need to recognize their patterns without feeling judged.

The workbook is not for everyone. It's for men ready to do the real work. The content should reflect that.

Are you ready to execute this plan?
