### What Men Actually Struggle With:
- **Mental Health** - Depression, anxiety, but won't get help
- **Loneliness** - Isolated but won't reach out
- **Financial Pressure** - Stressed but won't slow down
- **Relationship Issues** - Can't communicate but won't learn
- **Identity Crisis** - Lost but won't explore
- **Health Neglect** - Sick but won't seek help

### The Pattern:
**They KNOW they have problems, but they CAN'T/WON'T do anything about them.**

## STEP 2: CREATE THE CONFRONTATION

### The Formula:
**"You know you're [PAIN POINT], but you [AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR]."**

### Examples:
- "You know you're depressed, but you won't get help."
- "You know you're lonely, but you won't reach out."
- "You know you're stuck, but you don't know how to change."
- "You know you're failing, but you won't admit it."

## STEP 3: ADD THE DEFAULT MODE CONNECTION

### The Bridge:
**"That's your default mode talking. Not you."**

### Complete Hook:
**"You know you're depressed, but you won't get help. That's your default mode talking. Not you."**

## STEP 4: CREATE URGENCY

### The Stakes:
**"The longer you wait, the worse it gets."**

### Complete Hook:
**"You know you're depressed, but you won't get help. That's your default mode talking. Not you. The longer you wait, the worse it gets."**

## STEP 5: OFFER THE SOLUTION

### The Way Out:
**"The workbook shows you how to break free."**
