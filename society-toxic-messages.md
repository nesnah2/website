# How Society is Making Men Worse

Society isn't helping men. It's making their problems worse.

## The Toxic Messages Men Get Every Day:

**"Be a Man" Culture:**
- Don't show emotions
- Figure it out yourself
- Be strong, be confident
- Don't be weak

**Social Media Pressure:**
- Look at these successful men
- Perfect life posts
- Alpha male content
- Hustle culture

**Work Culture:**
- Work harder
- Be a leader
- Don't show weakness
- Success = worth

**Relationship Expectations:**
- Be the provider
- Don't be needy
- Be confident with women
- Don't be emotional

**Family/Social Pressure:**
- What are you doing with your life?
- When are you getting married/having kids?
- Why aren't you more successful?
- Be like your brother/friend

## The Result:

Society is teaching men to:
- Hide their real self
- Perform instead of be
- Compare themselves to others
- Suppress their emotions
- Tie their worth to external validation
- Never ask for help
- Pretend to have all the answers

Society is literally programming men to be stuck, confused, and performing versions of themselves.

This is why so many men feel like they're wearing masks, feeling alone even around people who love them, and constantly seeking validation they'll never find.

Because society taught them to look for it in all the wrong places.
