# Instagram Hook: "I'm Fine" - The Lie Every Man Tells

## Hook Variations:

### Version 1: Direct Confrontation
**"You say 'I'm fine' but you're drowning. You say 'I'm good' but you're lost. You say 'I don't care' but you're breaking inside. Stop lying to yourself. Stop performing. Start being real."**

### Version 2: Story-Based
**"I was sitting in my therapist's office when I realized I'd been saying 'I'm fine' for 10 years. Ten years of lying to myself. Ten years of performing. Ten years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Sound familiar?"**

### Version 3: Question-Based
**"When was the last time you were actually fine? When was the last time you told someone the truth about how you're really doing? When was the last time you stopped performing and started being real?"**

### Version 4: Pattern Recognition
**"Every man has the same script: 'I'm fine.' 'I'm good.' 'I don't care.' But behind those words is a man drowning, lost, and breaking inside. You're not fooling anyone - especially not yourself."**

### Version 5: The Cost
**"Every time you say 'I'm fine' when you're not, you're creating distance from who you really are. Every lie you tell yourself makes it harder to be real. Every performance makes it harder to be authentic."**

## Visual Ideas:
- **Hook:** Close-up of face saying "I'm fine" with sad expression
- **Problem:** Quick montage of different men saying the same phrases
- **Cost:** Visual metaphor of distance/barriers being created
- **Solution:** Removing masks, being vulnerable
- **CTA:** Direct eye contact, confident tone

## Music Suggestions:
- Emotional, building intensity
- Something that conveys both vulnerability and strength
- Avoid overly aggressive - this is about authenticity, not anger
