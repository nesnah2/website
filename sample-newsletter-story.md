**Hey [Name],**

I was alone in my apartment, making coffee, when I caught myself performing.

Not for anyone. There was no one there. Just me, the coffee maker, and the silence.

But there I was, standing straighter, adjusting my posture, making sure I looked "confident" even though no one could see me.

**That's when I realized: I'd been performing for so long, I didn't know how to stop.**

### The Story

Three years ago, I was sitting in my therapist's office, exhausted from a day of meetings where I'd been "on" the entire time. Smiling when I didn't feel like smiling. Nodding when I disagreed. Laughing at jokes that weren't funny.

"Tell me about your day," she said.

I started with the usual performance. "It was great! Really productive. I feel good about the direction we're heading."

She just looked at me. Not judging. Not pushing. Just... waiting.

The silence stretched. And stretched. And stretched.

Finally, I broke.

"It was exhausting," I said, my voice barely above a whisper. "I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted from pretending to be someone I'm not. From smiling when I want to cry. From saying yes when I want to say no. From being 'fine' when I'm falling apart."

The words came tumbling out. "I don't even know who I am anymore. I've been performing for so long, I've forgotten what it feels like to just... be."

She nodded. "And when you're alone? Do you still perform?"

I thought about it. About how I'd catch myself checking my reflection in windows. About how I'd rehearse conversations in the shower. About how I'd adjust my facial expression even when no one was watching.

"Yes," I admitted. "Even when I'm alone."

"That's not you," she said. "That's your default mode. It's been running the show for so long, it doesn't know how to turn off."

### What This Teaches Us

Most men don't realize they're performing. They think this is just "how they are." But it's not them - it's their default mode running on autopilot.

Your default mode learned to perform because it thought that's what kept you safe. Safe from rejection. Safe from judgment. Safe from being seen as weak or vulnerable.

But here's the thing: **You can't heal what you won't acknowledge. You can't grow what you won't face. You can't change what you won't admit.**

The performance isn't protecting you anymore. It's imprisoning you.

Every time you perform instead of being real, you're telling yourself that who you really are isn't good enough. That you need to be someone else to be loved, accepted, valued.

But that's not true. The men who break free from their default mode? They stop performing. They start being real. And they discover that real is so much more powerful than perfect.

### This Week's Reflection

Take 10 minutes this week to sit with this question:

**"When do I catch myself performing, even when no one is watching?"**

Write down whatever comes up, even if it feels uncomfortable. Notice the moments when you're adjusting your behavior, your posture, your expression - not for anyone else, but for some internal audience that's always watching.

The goal isn't to judge yourself. It's to see yourself clearly.

### This Week's Action

**Spend 10 minutes alone without any distractions.**

No phone. No music. No TV. No books. Just you, sitting in silence.

Notice what happens. Notice the urge to "do something" or "be productive." Notice the discomfort with just... being.

Don't try to fix it. Don't try to make it better. Just notice it.

That's where freedom begins.

You're not alone in this journey.

Keep waking up,

Mikkel

**P.S.** The first time I tried this exercise, I lasted 3 minutes before reaching for my phone. The discomfort was intense. But that discomfort? That's your default mode freaking out because it's not in control. Sit with it. It gets easier.
