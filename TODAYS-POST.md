# TODAY'S POST - HARDER VERSION

---

## **HOOK:**
**"Insecurity and doubting was my default. It cost me 28 years."**

---

## **CAPTION (HARDER):**

Insecurity and doubting was my default.

Nobody must see my real me was my core belief.

Laughing and morphing was my actions.

**It cost me 28 years.**

28 years of performing.
28 years of hiding.
28 years of never being real.

I thought it was who I was.
I thought I was just built this way.

**I was wrong.**

It was just my default.
An automatic pattern I'd built without knowing.

And I kept repeating it.
Every day. Every conversation. Every relationship.

**Long fall. Slow rise. Repeat.**

Until I learned that my emotional baseline was important.

Until I saw the pattern.

Until I built a new default from my present.

**Not from my past.**
**From where I was right now.**

Your default isn't who you are.
It's what you've built.

And if you don't change it, you'll keep repeating it.

**How many years has your default cost you?**

## **EVEN HARDER:**

Insecurity and doubting was my default.

**It cost me 28 years.**

28 years of performing.
28 years of never being real.
28 years of long falls and slow rises.

I thought it was who I was.

**I was wrong.**

It was just my default.
An automatic pattern I'd built.

And I kept repeating it.
Every day. Every conversation.

**Long fall. Slow rise. Repeat.**

Until I learned that my emotional baseline was important.

Until I built a new default from my present.

**Not from my past.**
**From where I was right now.**

Your default isn't who you are.
It's what you've built.

**How many years has your default cost you?**

## **THE DIFFERENCE:**

**❌ BEFORE:** "Your default isn't who you are" (too abstract)
**✅ NOW:** "It cost me 28 years" (real cost)

**❌ BEFORE:** "You can build a new one" (too easy)
**✅ NOW:** "How many years has your default cost you?" (hits harder)
