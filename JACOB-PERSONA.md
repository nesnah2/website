## 📊 JACOB'S AWARENESS STAGE

### CURRENTLY: STAGE 1 (UNAWARE)

**What he knows:** Nothing. Just scrolling, numb.

**What he thinks:** "Everything is fine. I'm just tired/stressed/busy."

**What he needs:** To be WOKEN UP. To see himself in the mirror.

**NOT ready for:**
- ❌ Solutions or advice
- ❌ Steps to fix it
- ❌ Your product
- ❌ Being told what to do
- ❌ Explanations or teaching

**READY for:**
- ✅ Recognition ("That's me!")
- ✅ Being understood
- ✅ Seeing himself clearly
- ✅ Knowing he's not alone
- ✅ A name for his pain

---

## 🎯 HOW TO SPEAK TO JACOB

### TONE:
- Direct, no bullshit
- Raw and honest
- Brother-to-brother (not guru-to-student)
- Vulnerable but strong
- Understanding but challenging

### LANGUAGE HE USES:
- "I'm fine" (when he's not)
- "Just tired" (when he's exhausted from performing)
- "Everyone feels like this" (normalizing his pain)
- "I'll change tomorrow" (never does)
- "I should be further along by now"
- "What's wrong with me?"

### WHAT MAKES HIM STOP SCROLLING:
1. **Specific behaviors he recognizes:** "Can't sit alone without reaching for phone"
2. **His exact thoughts:** "Did I say the right thing?"
3. **Visceral body sensations:** "Chest tight, throat closed"
4. **Paradox that hits home:** "I survived cancer but can't survive 10 minutes of silence"
5. **Questions that make him think:** "Do you feel like a chameleon?"

   - YES = Post it
   - NO = Rewrite

## 💬 EXAMPLE POSTS THAT WORK FOR JACOB

### POST 1: THE CHAMELEON
```
Do you feel like a chameleon?

For 28 years, I was an exhausted chameleon in relationships.

Different person with different people.
Funny guy with some friends.
Serious guy with others.
Agreeable around my wife.
Tough around certain men.

I thought I was being adaptive.
The truth? I was terrified of being rejected for who I actually was.

So I morphed.
And morphed.
Until I didn't know who I was anymore.

Sound familiar?
```

### POST 2: THE CANCER PARADOX
```
I survived cancer.

Beat addiction.

Buried my father.

But you know what I couldn't survive?

Being alone with myself for 10 minutes.

I'd beaten death but I couldn't face my own thoughts.

Is this you too?
```

### POST 3: THE NIGHT SCROLL
```
11:47 PM.

Lying in bed.
Can't stop scrolling.

'I'll feel better tomorrow.'
'Everyone feels like this.'

This was me for 28 years.

I didn't know I was drowning.
I thought I was just tired from swimming.

You're not tired.
You're exhausted from performing.

Sound familiar?
```
