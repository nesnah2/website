# Instagram Carousel: "The Things Men Say (But Don't Mean)"

## Slide 1: The Agreement Trap
**"You're nodding along to things you don't believe. Laughing at jokes that aren't funny. Agreeing with opinions that make you cringe. You're so desperate to fit in, you've forgotten what you actually think."**

## Slide 2: The Fake Interests
**"You're pretending to care about their hobbies, their stories, their problems. You're asking follow-up questions about shit you couldn't care less about. You're performing interest to buy their approval."**

## Slide 3: The Compromise Everything
**"You're saying yes to plans you hate. Going to places you don't want to go. Spending time with people who drain you. You're trading your preferences for their acceptance."**

## Slide 4: The Fake Laugh
**"You're laughing at their jokes even when they're not funny. You're smiling when you want to cry. You're acting happy when you're miserable. Your face is a lie."**

## Slide 5: The Fake Opinions
**"You're parroting their beliefs to avoid conflict. You're hiding your real thoughts to stay safe. You're becoming a mirror of what they want to see. You're losing yourself in the reflection."**

## Slide 6: The Truth
**"You're not being liked for who you are - you're being liked for who you're pretending to be. They don't love the real you because they've never met him. You're invisible behind the performance."**

## Slide 7: The Solution
**"STOP. Stop saying shit you don't mean. Stop pretending to care about things you don't. Stop being liked for being someone else. I'll teach you how to be liked for being YOU. DM me 'REAL' now."**
