# Instagram Reel Script: "Men Saying Things They Don't Mean"

## Hook (0-3 seconds)
**"Men say 'I'm fine' when they're drowning. They say 'I don't care' when they're breaking inside. They say 'I'm good' when they're lost. Here's what they really mean..."**

## Problem Setup (3-8 seconds)
**"You're lying to yourself and everyone around you. You're wearing masks so thick you've forgotten who you really are. You're performing so well you've convinced yourself it's real."**

## The Truth (8-15 seconds)
**"When you say 'I'm fine' - you mean 'I'm drowning and I don't know how to ask for help.' When you say 'I don't care' - you mean 'I care so much it's destroying me.' When you say 'I'm good' - you mean 'I'm lost and I don't know how to find my way back.'"**

## The Cost (15-22 seconds)
**"Every lie you tell yourself creates distance from who you really are. Every mask you wear makes it harder to take off. Every performance makes it harder to be real. You're not fooling anyone - especially not yourself."**

## The Solution (22-30 seconds)
**"STOP LYING. Stop saying things you don't mean. Stop wearing masks. Stop performing. Start being honest about where you really are. Start asking for help when you need it. Start being the man you're pretending to be."**

## Call to Action (30-35 seconds)
**"If you're tired of lying to yourself, if you're ready to stop performing and start being real, DM me 'REAL' now. This ends today."**

## Alternative Hook Options:
1. **"Men lie to themselves more than they lie to anyone else. Here's what they're really saying..."**
2. **"Every man has a script. A performance. A mask. Here's what's really behind the words..."**
3. **"Men say one thing but mean another. They've been doing it so long they've forgotten how to be real..."**

## Visual Suggestions:
- **Hook:** Close-up of face looking directly at camera
- **Problem:** Quick cuts of different men saying "I'm fine" with sad expressions
- **Truth:** Split screen showing what they say vs. what they mean
- **Cost:** Visual of masks being layered on
- **Solution:** Removing masks, being vulnerable
- **CTA:** Direct eye contact with camera, confident tone

## Music Suggestions:
- Emotional, building intensity
- Something that matches the vulnerability and strength of the message
- Avoid overly aggressive music - this is about vulnerability, not anger
