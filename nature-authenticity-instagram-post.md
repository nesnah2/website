# Instagram Post: Nature & Authenticity

## Post Caption:

It's crazy. We are the only living organism with actually ability to change our natural purpose. We are born into the unknown, with no direction, unless we choose one.

The animals, plants, water etc all have a purpose. A function directed by the nature and universe. They don't even have to choose, the direction is demanded and dictated. Nothing to prove.

A bird know what to do, where and how to fly. A lion knows by heart how to hunt and provide. Instinct and intuition. Authentic is non negotiable. The behavior is layed out and it's been that way since forever.

They are never forced to change, only if humans choose to destroy the beauty of the nature. They don't need directions or guidelines, they already know.

Put a bird in a nest, a lion in a cage and watch the soul of the nature fade.

Look at the fucking world we created.
The nest is our mind.
Most people don't even know this.
Limit reach. Doubt in intuitions. Fear of authenticity.

The more we fight against the basic of nature to prove human is the strongest and most clever on earth- the more fucking confused we get.

You have the privilege to tap in and change.
Environment, tribe, direction. Everything is there for you to change.
You can change into someone you want to be!

Meanwhile the "real nature" doesn't give a fuck. They just live.

That is the beauty of being in nature.
It will provide you with the basic knowledge for direction authentic living.

REAL direction REAL authenticity.

Hug a tree and say thank you. The only quick fix that is guaranteed

## Alternative Shorter Version (if you prefer):

We are the only living organism that can change our natural purpose. We're born into the unknown, with no direction, unless we choose one.

Animals, plants, water - they all have a purpose. A function directed by nature. They don't choose, the direction is demanded. Nothing to prove.

A bird knows how to fly. A lion knows how to hunt. Instinct and intuition. Authentic is non-negotiable.

Put a bird in a nest, a lion in a cage - watch the soul of nature fade.

Look at the world we created.
The nest is our mind.
Most people don't even know this.

The more we fight against nature to prove we're the strongest - the more confused we get.

You have the privilege to change.
Environment, tribe, direction. Everything.

Meanwhile nature doesn't give a fuck. They just live.

That's the beauty of being in nature.
It provides the basic knowledge for authentic living.

REAL direction. REAL authenticity.

Hug a tree and say thank you. The only quick fix that's guaranteed.
