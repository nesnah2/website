## SIMPLE POST EXAMPLES

### "You think you're choosing. You're not."
```
You think you're choosing to get defensive.

You think you're choosing to shut down.

You think you're choosing to overthink.

You're not.

Your default mode is choosing for you.

It's been pulling your strings for years.

You just didn't know it.

#DefaultMode #MensWork
```

### "Why you keep making the same mistakes"
```
Smart men make stupid decisions.

Not because they're stupid.

Because their default mode overrides their intelligence.

You know what you should do.

Then watch yourself do the opposite.

Your default mode doesn't care about logic.

It cares about safety.

Even when that safety is actually dangerous.

#DefaultMode #MensWork
```

### "You're protecting your own hostage-taker"
```
You defend the patterns that are killing you.

You'll argue for your limitations.

You'll justify your self-sabotage.

You'll protect your default mode like it's your best friend.

But it's not your friend.

It's your hostage-taker.

And you're protecting your own hostage-taker.

#DefaultMode #MensWork
```

### "The workbook most men won't finish"
```
Most men won't finish this workbook.

They'll download it, skim it, and go back to their comfortable lies.

Because this workbook is not for everyone.

It's for men ready to do the real work.

Men who are tired of living on autopilot.

Men who want to be the man they're meant to be.

The workbook is coming October 10th.

Are you ready?
