# CONTENT CREATION BLUEPRINT

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025

## THE FINAL FORMULA (USE THIS EVERY TIME)

### THE STRUCTURE:

**HOOK (3 seconds):** HIS pain, universal, direct
↓
**BODY (30 seconds):** YOUR specific memory of that pain
↓
**BRIDGE (10 seconds):** Connect your experience back to HIS
↓
**END (5 seconds):** Question to HIM

---

## STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: HOOK (Start with HIS pain)

**Template:**
"[Universal behavior Jacob does]"

**NOT:** "I still remember..."

**BUT:** "You [behavior]. And it's [feeling]."

**Example:**
"You sit at family dinners waiting to be asked a question. Already rehearsing the answer."

---

### STEP 2: EXPAND HIS PAIN (5-10 seconds)

**Describe what HE experiences:**
- Body sensations HE feels
- Thoughts HE has
- What HE does

**Example:**
"Chest tight. Throat closed. Preparing what to say. How to laugh. What expression to make. Completely alone at a table full of people."

---

### STEP 3: YOUR STORY (20-25 seconds)

**NOW bring in YOUR experience:**

"I did this for [X years].

[Specific memory - body, voice, behavior].

[What it felt like].

[What it cost you]."

**Example:**
"I did this for 28 years. Every family dinner. The voice: 'They can tell you're faking.' I'd eat fast. Make an excuse. Leave early. Because being there meant performing when I was already exhausted."

---

### STEP 4: BRIDGE BACK TO HIM (5-10 seconds)

**Connect your story to his reality:**

"Maybe you do this too.

Leave early.

Make excuses.

Anything to escape the performance."

---

### STEP 5: END WITH QUESTION

"Does this resonate, man?"

OR

"Are you doing this too?"

---

## FULL EXAMPLE USING THE FORMULA:

```
[HOOK - HIS PAIN]
You sit at family dinners completely alone.

[HIS EXPERIENCE]
Waiting for someone to ask you a question.

Already preparing the answer.

Chest tight. Throat closed.

Rehearsing how to laugh. What to say. How to seem normal.

[YOUR STORY]
I did this for 28 years.

Every family dinner, the voice: "They can tell you're faking it."

So I'd eat fast. Make an excuse. Leave early.

Because being there meant performing.

And I was already exhausted from performing everywhere else.

[BRIDGE TO HIM]
Maybe you do this too.

Leave early. Make excuses.

Anything to escape the room.

[QUESTION]
Does this resonate, man?
```

---

## THE RATIO:

**40% about HIS pain** (hook + his experience + bridge)
**40% about YOUR story** (your memory validates you understand)
**20% back to HIM** (bridge + question)

**STARTS with him. ENDS with him. YOUR story in the middle.**

---

## 20-MINUTE DAILY CONTENT PROCESS:

### STEP 1: PICK TOPIC (2 minutes)

**Use the 100 hooks list.**

Scroll through. Pick ONE that makes your chest tight.

Don't overthink. First one that hits = go.

---

### STEP 2: REMEMBER (3 minutes)

**Close your eyes.**

**Go back to a SPECIFIC moment when you experienced that pain.**

**Ask yourself:**
- Where was I?
- What was happening?
- What did my body feel? (chest, throat, stomach)
- What was the voice saying?

**Just REMEMBER. Don't write yet.**

---

### STEP 3: WRITE FAST (10 minutes)

**Open notes app. Type fast. No editing.**

**Use the 5-step structure above.**

**Set timer for 10 minutes. Write until timer stops.**

**NO DELETING. NO EDITING. JUST WRITE.**

---

### STEP 4: ONE QUICK PASS (3 minutes)

**Read it once.**

**Only fix:**
- ❌ Obvious typos
- ❌ Judgment words (weak, pathetic, stupid) → replace with feeling words

**Don't rewrite. Don't perfect. Just clean obvious errors.**

---

### STEP 5: POST (2 minutes)

**Copy. Paste. Post.**

**NO reading it 10 times.**

**NO "is this good enough?"**

**JUST POST.**

---

## LANGUAGE GUIDE

### BANNED JUDGMENT WORDS (Never use):

❌ Pathetic
❌ Weak
❌ Stupid
❌ Lazy
❌ Coward
❌ Idiot
❌ Loser

---

### APPROVED EMPATHY WORDS (Always safe):

✅ Terrifying
✅ Exhausting
✅ Overwhelming
✅ Protective
✅ Surviving
✅ Couldn't figure out
✅ Didn't know how
✅ Trying to

---

### THE "NOT BECAUSE/BUT BECAUSE" RULE

**Always explain the WHY without judgment:**

**STRUCTURE:**
"I did [behavior]. Not because [judgment], but because [fear/feeling]."

**EXAMPLES:**

"I shut down. Not because I didn't care, but because opening up felt like bleeding in front of strangers."

"I isolated. Not because I hated people, but because being alone meant I didn't have to pretend I was okay."

"I lied and said 'I'm fine.' Not because I wanted to lie, but because the truth felt too heavy to share."

---

## LEVEL 3 WRITING (INSIDE THE EXPERIENCE)

**Instead of:** "I felt scared"

**Say:** "My chest would tighten. Throat close. I'd look for the exit."

---

**Instead of:** "I was afraid of being seen"

**Say:** "The thought of them really seeing me - the panic would kick in. Like being naked in public."

---

**Instead of:** "I isolated to protect myself"

**Say:** "Being alone meant I didn't have to perform. Didn't have to wonder if I was doing it right. Didn't have to see the disappointment in their eyes when they realized I wasn't who I was pretending to be."

---

## THE RULE:

**ALWAYS add:**
- The body sensation (chest tight, throat closed, stomach drop)
- The specific thought (what the voice said exactly)
- The why that's NOT clinical (not "to protect myself" but "because the alternative was terrifying")

---

## CONTENT POSTING RATIO

### WEEKS 1-4 (Building Trust):

**Daily posts:**
- 4 recognition posts (no CTA)
- 1 post with soft CTA ("link in bio")

**Focus:** Growth and trust-building

---

### WEEKS 5-8 (Trust Established):

**Daily posts:**
- 3 recognition posts (no CTA)
- 2 posts with CTA

**Focus:** Soft selling, building volume

---

### WEEKS 9-12 (Ready to Monetize):

**Daily posts:**
- 3 recognition posts
- 2 CTA posts
- Launch weeks: daily CTAs

**Focus:** Hard launches, urgency campaigns

---

## THE 90-DAY RULES

**1. Post daily for 90 days** (harsh recognition content, YOUR voice)

**2. Engage 90-120 min daily** (100+ comments on other accounts)

**3. NO changing the strategy** (even when it feels slow)

**4. NO second-guessing every 24 hours** (judge at Day 30, Day 60, Day 90 only)

**5. NO adding "daily life" content** (until you hit 5,000 followers)

**6. Focus on DMs and calls** (that's where the money is, not likes)

**7. Close high-ticket clients** (that's the business model)

---

## REMEMBER:

**STARTS with him. ENDS with him. YOUR story in the middle.**

**Good enough > perfect.**

**20 minutes per post. No exceptions.**

**Post whatever comes out in those 20 minutes.**

---

**NO MORE ASKING "IS THIS GOOD?"**

**JUST POST IT.**
