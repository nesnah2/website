### **Template 1: Controversial Truth + Personal Story**

**Post:**
```
The biggest lie men tell: "I'm fine."

Two words. A complete lie.

I was sitting in my therapist's office, exhausted from a day of meetings where I'd been "on" the entire time.

"Tell me about your day," she said.

I started with the usual performance. "It was great! Really productive."

She just looked at me. Waiting.

Finally, I broke.

"It was exhausting," I said. "I'm exhausted from pretending to be someone I'm not."

That's when I realized: I'd been performing for so long, I didn't know how to stop.

You say "I'm fine" when you're drowning.
When you're breaking.
When you're lost.

But "I'm fine" isn't strength.
It's protection.
It's avoidance.
It's isolation.

Your default mode is keeping you safe.
But it's also keeping you stuck.

Stop saying "I'm fine."
Start being honest.
Start being real.
Start being human.

The men who break free from their default mode?
They stop saying "I'm fine."
They start saying "I'm struggling."
"I need help."
"I don't know what to do."
"I'm scared."
"I'm lost."
"I'm not okay."

That's not weakness.
That's courage.
That's the beginning of freedom.

Comment "ME" if you've said "I'm fine" when you weren't.

### **Template 2: Direct Challenge + Carousel**

**Carousel Post (5 slides):**

**Slide 1:**
```
Most men are still boys.

They're just taller now.
```

**Slide 2:**
```
You're still performing for approval.

Still seeking validation from others.

Still trying to prove yourself.

That's not how men act.

That's how boys act.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
You're addicted to being liked.

Every decision, every word, every action is filtered through "Will they approve?"

You're living for their validation instead of your own.

That's boy behavior.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
You're terrified of letting people down.

Scared of conflict.

Avoiding difficult conversations.

You'd rather suffer in silence than risk their disapproval.

That's not strength.

That's fear.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
You feel like a boy because you're still acting like one.

You're still seeking external validation instead of building internal strength.

You're still performing instead of being.

You're still waiting instead of creating.

ENOUGH.

Stop acting like a boy.

Stop seeking approval.

Stop waiting for permission.

Tag a man who needs this.

### **Template 3: Question + Story + Lesson**

**Post:**
```
What's the scariest thing about being honest?

For me, it was admitting I didn't know who I was.

I'd been performing for so long, I'd forgotten what it felt like to just... be.

Last week, someone asked me what I liked to do for fun.

I drew a blank.

Not because I don't have hobbies.
But because I've been so focused on what I think I should like, I've forgotten what I actually enjoy.

That's the cost of performance.
That's the cost of pretending.

You lose yourself in the act.

You become the mask.

You forget who you really are.

The men who break free from their default mode?
They stop performing.
They start being real.
And they discover that real is so much more powerful than perfect.

What do you genuinely enjoy when no one is watching?

## ðŸ“± **Reel Scripts for Algorithm Boost**

### **Reel 1: "The Performance Never Stops" (30 seconds)**

**Script:**
```
[Text on screen: "The Performance Never Stops"]

[You speaking directly to camera]

"I was alone in my apartment, making coffee, when I caught myself performing.

Not for anyone. There was no one there.

But there I was, standing straighter, adjusting my posture, making sure I looked 'confident' even though no one could see me.

That's when I realized: I'd been performing for so long, I didn't know how to stop.

[Text on screen: "You're performing even when alone"]

Your default mode has been running the show for so long, it doesn't know how to turn off.

[Text on screen: "Stop performing. Start being real."]

The men who break free from their default mode?

They stop performing.

They start being real.

And they discover that real is so much more powerful than perfect.

[Text on screen: "Follow for more truth"]

### **Reel 2: "The Approval Addiction" (25 seconds)**

**Script:**
```
[Text on screen: "The Approval Addiction"]

[You speaking directly to camera]

"I was making a decision about my career when I realized I was asking everyone except myself.

'What do you think I should do?'

'Do you think this is a good idea?'

'Will people approve of this?'

[Text on screen: "You're seeking validation from everyone except yourself"]

I was living for their validation instead of my own.

That's boy behavior.

[Text on screen: "Men make their own decisions"]

The men who break free from their default mode?

They stop seeking approval.

They start making their own decisions.

They start living for their own validation.

[Text on screen: "What would you choose if no one's opinion mattered?"]
