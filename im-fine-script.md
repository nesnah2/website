# "I'M FINE" SCRIPT
*The Biggest Lie Men Tell*

---

## THE SCRIPT

**The biggest lie men tell: "I'm fine."**

Two words. A complete lie.

You say it when you're drowning.

You say it when you're breaking.

You say it when you're lost.

"I'm fine."

It's your default mode talking.

Not you.

Your default mode doesn't want you to be vulnerable.

It doesn't want you to ask for help.

It doesn't want you to admit you're struggling.

Because vulnerability feels dangerous.

Asking for help feels weak.

Admitting struggle feels like failure.

So you say "I'm fine."

Even when you're not.

Even when you need support.

Even when you're falling apart.

"I'm fine."

It's not strength. It's protection.

It's not courage. It's avoidance.

It's not independence. It's isolation.

Your default mode is keeping you safe.

But it's also keeping you stuck.

Because you can't heal what you won't acknowledge.

You can't grow what you won't face.

You can't change what you won't admit.

"I'm fine."

Stop saying it.

Start being honest.

Start being real.

Start being human.

The men who break free from their default mode?

They stop saying "I'm fine."

They start saying "I'm struggling."

"I need help."

"I don't know what to do."

"I'm scared."

"I'm lost."

"I'm not okay."

That's not weakness.

That's courage.

That's the beginning of freedom.

Stop protecting your own hostage-taker.

Stop saying "I'm fine."

Start telling the truth.
