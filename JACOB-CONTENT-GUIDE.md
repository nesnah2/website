# **JACOB-FOCUSED CONTENT CREATION GUIDE**

## **UNDERSTANDING JACOB (YOUR TARGET READER)**

### **JACOB'S DAILY REALITY:**
- Wakes up already exhausted
- Scrolls Instagram in bed (sees guys with better lives)
- Feels inadequate before day even starts
- Puts on his "work persona" like a costume
- Changes personality for boss vs. colleagues
- Has surface-level conversations with "friends"
- Shuts down when partner tries to connect emotionally
- Can't sit in silence without distracting himself
- Lies awake overthinking at night

### **JACOB'S INTERNAL MONOLOGUE:**
- "I'm 35 and still don't know who I am"
- "Everyone else seems to have it figured out"
- "I'm performing 24/7 but no one can know"
- "I don't feel like I'm enough for anyone"
- "This can't be all there is to life"
- "I can't talk to anyone about this"
- "I'm tired of pretending but don't know how to stop"

### **JACOB'S PAIN POINTS:**
- **Identity Crisis:** "I don't know who I actually am"
- **Father Wounds:** "I'm still trying to prove myself to my dead/absent father"
- **Relationship Struggles:** "I push away the people I love"
- **Self-Worth Issues:** "I feel like a failure even though I'm doing 'okay'"
- **Isolation:** "I have no one to talk to about this"

## **CONTENT TEMPLATES BY PAIN POINT**

### **1. IDENTITY CRISIS TEMPLATE**

```
You're a different person with different people.
Funny guy with some friends.
Serious guy with others.
Agreeable around your partner.
Tough around certain men.

This isn't adaptability.
It's your default mode protecting you from rejection.

I know because I was a chameleon for 28 years.
Different voice, different opinions, different energy.
Until I couldn't recognize myself anymore.

The breakthrough came when I realized:
I wasn't adapting to situations.
I was hiding from the fear that the real me wasn't enough.

Breaking this pattern allowed me to finally be one person, everywhere.

That's why I created the Default Mode Workbook.

DM me "REAL" for early access when it releases October 10th.

For men tired of performing.
```

### **2. FATHER WOUNDS TEMPLATE**

```
You still hear your father's voice when you get angry.
You see him in your reactions to your kids.
You feel him in your fears and insecurities.

This isn't just "daddy issues."
It's your default mode running on inherited programming.

I know because I carried my father's demons for decades.
I hated him for installing these patterns in me.
Until I realized what was really happening.

The breakthrough came when I understood:
He was just a man doing his best with what he had.
And I could choose to break the legacy instead of blaming him.

Breaking this pattern freed me from repeating his mistakes.

That's why I created the Default Mode Workbook.

DM me "FATHER" for early access when it releases October 10th.

For men ready to write their own story.
```

### **3. RELATIONSHIP STRUGGLES TEMPLATE**

```
You shut down when your partner asks what's wrong.
You deflect when conversations get too deep.
You create distance when intimacy feels threatening.

This isn't about communication skills.
It's your default mode protecting your vulnerabilities.

I know because I pushed away everyone who got too close.
I'd rather end relationships than risk being truly seen.
Until I recognized the pattern destroying my connections.

The breakthrough came when I realized:
I wasn't afraid of their rejection.
I was afraid of facing parts of myself I'd been avoiding.

Breaking this pattern transformed every relationship in my life.

That's why I created the Default Mode Workbook.

DM me "CONNECT" for early access when it releases October 10th.

For men tired of pushing people away.
```

### **4. SELF-WORTH ISSUES TEMPLATE**

```
You achieve goals but never feel successful.
You receive praise but never feel worthy.
You look good on paper but feel like a fraud inside.

This isn't imposter syndrome.
It's your default mode keeping you safe through constant striving.

I know because I chased achievement for decades.
New title. Higher salary. Better body. Bigger house.
Until I realized no achievement would ever be enough.

The breakthrough came when I understood:
I wasn't trying to succeed.
I was trying to outrun the feeling that I wasn't enough.

Breaking this pattern allowed me to finally feel worthy without proving it.

That's why I created the Default Mode Workbook.

DM me "WORTHY" for early access when it releases October 10th.

For men tired of never feeling enough.
```

### **5. ISOLATION TEMPLATE**

```
You have people around you but feel completely alone.
You talk all day but never say what matters.
You're surrounded but isolated in your thoughts.

This isn't introversion or social anxiety.
It's your default mode keeping your real struggles hidden.

I know because I lived in this isolation for 28 years.
I had friends, colleagues, even partners.
But no one knew the man behind the mask.

The breakthrough came when I finally told another man:
"I'm not okay. And I don't know how to be."
And heard: "Me too, brother."

Breaking this pattern connected me to real brotherhood for the first time.

That's why I created the Default Mode Workbook.

DM me "BROTHER" for early access when it releases October 10th.

For men tired of being alone in a crowd.
```
