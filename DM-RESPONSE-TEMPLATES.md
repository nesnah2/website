## 🎯 **WHEN SOMEONE ASKS: "What is it?"**

```
It's a free guide about breaking free from your default mode - the automatic patterns that keep you stuck.

Shows you why you're performing everywhere, can't sit in silence, and feel exhausted from being different with everyone.

Free. No catch. Just real work.

## ⏱️ **WHEN SOMEONE ASKS: "How long does it take?"**

```
Free guide: 1-2 hours if you do it honestly.

Full workbook: Most guys take 2-4 weeks.

But there's no rush. Work at your own pace.

This isn't a quick fix. It's deep work.

The same process took me years to figure out, but the workbook makes it way faster.
```

## 🤔 **WHEN SOMEONE ASKS: "Is this for me?"**

```
Real talk - it's for you if:

✅ You're performing 24/7 and exhausted
✅ Different person with different people
✅ Can't sit in silence without reaching for your phone
✅ Say "I'm fine" when you're not
✅ Feel like a boy pretending to be a man
✅ Ready to do uncomfortable work

NOT for you if:

❌ You want quick fixes
❌ You're not ready to face yourself
❌ You just want to feel better without doing the work
❌ You need someone to fix you

I can't fix you. Only show you the patterns.

You do the work.

## 💬 **WHEN SOMEONE ASKS: "Will this actually help?"**

```
Honest answer: It changed my life.

But I can't promise it'll work for you.

The workbook is the same process that helped me break free from 28 years of performing, hiding, and living on autopilot.

If you actually do the work - not just read it, but ANSWER the questions - it'll show you things about yourself you've been avoiding.

Whether that helps depends on what you do with what you see.

Try the free guide first. See if it resonates.

Then decide.

## 🔄 **WHEN SOMEONE ASKS: "Can I get a refund?"**

**For Free Guide:**
```
It's free. No refund needed 😄

Just grab it and see if it helps.
```

**For Full Workbook:**
```
Yeah, if it doesn't help, just email me within 30 days.

I'll refund you. No questions asked.

I'd rather you have your money back than feel like you wasted $67.
```

---

## ❓ **WHEN SOMEONE ASKS: "What if I get stuck?"**

```
DM me.

Seriously. If you get stuck on an exercise or something comes up that's heavy, just message me.

I'm not running some massive automated system.

I actually help the men who do this work.

No extra charge. Just part of doing it right.
```

---

## 🎯 **WHEN SOMEONE SAYS: "I'll think about it"**

```
No pressure at all man.

It'll be here when you're ready.

The free guide isn't going anywhere.

Link's in my bio if you want to check it out later.

Either way, hope you're doing well.
```

---

## 💪 **WHEN SOMEONE SAYS: "I'm not sure I'm ready"**

```
That's actually a good sign.

Men who aren't ready don't even question it.

The fact that you're asking means part of you knows something needs to change.

Start with the free guide. It's just 2 phases.

See how it feels.

You'll know pretty quick if you're ready to go deeper.

No commitment. No pressure.

Just truth.
```

---

## 🔥 **WHEN SOMEONE SAYS: "This sounds intense"**

```
It is.

This isn't "5 tips to feel better" content.

It's the real work.

The stuff that makes you uncomfortable because it makes you see yourself clearly.

But that's also why it works.

Surface-level stuff gives surface-level results.

This goes deep.

Only do it if you're actually ready.
```

---

## 🤝 **WHEN SOMEONE SAYS: "Thanks man, I needed this"**

```
Glad it resonates brother.

Do the work. Answer the questions honestly.

And reach out if you need anything.

You're not alone in this.
