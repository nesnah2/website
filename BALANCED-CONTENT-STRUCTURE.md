# HOW TO MENTION PAIN WITHOUT DWELLING ON IT

---

## **THE STRUCTURE:**

### **MENTION PAIN BRIEFLY → FOCUS ON TRANSFORMATION**

**NOT:**
- Long story about the pain
- Detailed description of suffering
- Heavy emotional weight

**YES:**
- Quick mention ("I used to...")
- Then immediately pivot to transformation
- Focus on where you are NOW

---

## **THE FORMULA:**

**"I used to [pain].**
**Now I [transformation].**
**Not because [external thing changed].**
**Because [I did the work]."**

---

## **EXAMPLES:**

### **EXAMPLE 1: TIVOLI MOMENT**

**❌ TOO MUCH PAIN:**
"I used to hate my first kid. I saw him as a component. I was performing fatherhood. I felt nothing. I was completely disconnected. I isolated. I shut down. I..."

**✅ BALANCED:**
"I used to perform fatherhood instead of being present.
Yesterday, I was just present with my daughter.
Not performing. Not thinking about what I should be doing.
Just there.
Not because she changed.
Because I did.
What changed for you recently?"

**Pain mentioned: 1 sentence**
**Transformation focus: Rest of post**

---

### **EXAMPLE 2: LONELINESS**

**❌ TOO MUCH PAIN:**
"I used to escape into noisy loneliness. I felt unwanted. I isolated. I disconnected. I created distance. I felt completely alone..."

**✅ BALANCED:**
"I used to escape into noisy loneliness.
Now I can sit with myself.
Not because the loneliness went away.
Because I learned to be with it.
What have you learned to sit with?"

**Pain mentioned: 1 sentence**
**Transformation focus: Rest of post**

### **EXAMPLE 3: PERFORMANCE**

**❌ TOO MUCH PAIN:**
"I used to perform everywhere. I rehearsed conversations. I planned every word. I was exhausted from pretending. I felt alone even with people..."

**✅ BALANCED:**
"I used to perform everywhere.
Now I can just be.
Not because life got easier.
Because I stopped running from what I was avoiding.
What are you running from?"

**Pain mentioned: 1 sentence**
**Transformation focus: Rest of post**

## **THE RULE:**

### **MENTION PAIN IN 1-2 SENTENCES MAX**

**Then immediately pivot to:**
- Where you are NOW
- What changed
- What you learned
- The transformation

---

## **STRUCTURE TEMPLATE:**

**1. Quick pain mention (1-2 sentences)**
"I used to [pain]."

**2. Transformation (2-3 sentences)**
"Now I [transformation]."

**3. Why it changed (1 sentence)**
"Not because [external]. Because [internal work]."

**4. Question (1 sentence)**
"What changed for you?"

## **TODAY'S POST (BALANCED):**

**"I used to perform fatherhood instead of being present.**
**Yesterday, I was just there with my daughter.**
**Not performing. Not thinking. Just present.**
**Not because she changed.**
**Because I did.**
**What changed for you recently?"**

**Pain: 1 sentence**
**Transformation: Rest**

---

## **THE KEY:**

**MENTION THE PAIN BRIEFLY.**
**DWELL ON THE TRANSFORMATION.**

**The pain is the setup.**
**The transformation is the story.**

**Try this structure. Mention pain quickly, then focus on the light.** 🔥
