                    <h3>What kind of men do you work with?</h3>
                    <p>Men who are ready to drop the mask, face themselves, and create real change. You don't need to have it all together—just a willingness to be honest and show up. I work with men who are feeling stuck, lost, or disconnected from their authentic selves.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What results can I expect?</h3>
                    <p>Clarity, confidence, and a renewed sense of purpose. You'll learn to trust yourself, speak your truth, and build a life that feels real—on your terms. Most men experience greater self-awareness, improved relationships, and a stronger sense of direction in their lives.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is this therapy?</h3>
                    <p>No. This is not therapy or counseling. It's direct, practical mentoring focused on presence, action, and transformation—man to man. While therapy often focuses on healing past wounds, mentoring focuses on building your future and creating the life you want to live.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is everything confidential?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. What you share stays between us. Trust and respect are the foundation of this work. I understand that you're sharing deeply personal experiences, and I take confidentiality very seriously.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
                    <p>Just reach out. We'll have a real conversation—no pressure, no sales pitch. If it feels right, we'll take the next step together. You can email me directly or book a free discovery call to see if we're a good fit.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does the process take?</h3>
                    <p>Transformation is a journey, not a destination. Most men see significant changes within the first 30 days, but lasting change requires ongoing commitment. I offer different program lengths to meet you where you are—from a 30-day discovery to a 6-month mastery program.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I'm not sure if this is right for me?</h3>
                    <p>That's exactly why I offer a free discovery call. We'll spend 30 minutes talking about your situation, what you're looking for, and whether we're a good fit. There's no pressure to commit—it's just a conversation between two men.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you work with men outside your country?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, I work with men worldwide through video calls. The work we do is universal—it's about human nature and personal transformation, not geography. All sessions are conducted online for your convenience.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What makes your approach different?</h3>
                    <p>I've been where you are. I understand the struggle because I lived it. This isn't theory—it's real experience. I focus on practical, actionable steps rather than just talking about problems. We work on breaking down your default mode patterns and building new ways of being.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I'm not ready to change?</h3>
                    <p>That's completely okay. This work requires readiness and willingness. If you're not ready, that's actually a sign of self-awareness. When you are ready, I'll be here. The door is always open.</p>
