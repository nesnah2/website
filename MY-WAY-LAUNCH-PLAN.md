# MY WAY - SIMPLE LAUNCH PLAN
**No Plan B. Fully Committed. Let's Go.** 🔥

---

## 🎯 **THE TRUTH I NOW KNOW:**

- ✅ I'm good at being real in person
- ✅ Online (Instagram) is strange for me
- ✅ 2 hours for 30 seconds = wrong format
- ✅ Simple raw videos about pain = my format
- ✅ Deep work with 10-20 men = my model
- ✅ Not $100k/month scaling = my path is different
- ✅ Workbook changed my life = it works
- ✅ Feel like fraud = my default mode showing up
- ✅ No plan B = fully committed

### **MY MESSAGE TEMPLATES:**

**Template 1: Personal**
```
Hey [Name],

Been thinking about you lately.

I've been working on something for men dealing with [their specific struggle].

Made a workbook about breaking free from default patterns.

Thought of you.

$67 if you want to check it out: [link]

No pressure either way.

- Mikkel
```

**Template 2: Honest**
```
[Name],

Real talk.

I spent 2 years trying to "build a business" making content.

Turns out I'm shit at that.

But I'm good at helping men 1:1.

Made a workbook about breaking free from patterns keeping you stuck.

$67: [link]

Or just DM me if you want to talk.

- Mikkel
```

**Template 3: Direct**
```
Hey [Name],

Quick question - do you ever feel like you're performing 24/7 but can't let anyone see it?

I spent 28 years doing that. Made a workbook about breaking free.

$67 if you're interested: [link]

- Mikkel
```

**Goal: 10 messages per day**

## 💬 **MY DM RESPONSE TEMPLATES:**

### **When someone asks "What is it?":**
```
It's a workbook about breaking free from your default mode - the automatic patterns that keep you stuck.

8 phases, 12 exercises. Same process that helped me transform.

$67 for lifetime access. Works on phone, tablet, computer.

Happy to answer any questions.
```

### **When someone asks "How does it work?":**
```
You work through 8 phases at your own pace.

Each phase has exercises that help you see your patterns, understand where they come from, and break free.

It's deep work. Not a quick fix. But it's the same process that changed my life.

Takes most guys 2-4 weeks to complete.
```

### **When someone asks about price:**
```
$67 one-time payment. Lifetime access.

No monthly fees. You own it forever.

Launch pricing - will go up to $97 after first 50 members.
```

### **When someone hesitates:**
```
No pressure at all man.

It's here if you need it.

Either way, happy to talk if you want to chat about what you're going through.
```

## 💪 **MY MINDSET SHIFTS:**

### **OLD THINKING:**
- "I need to be like them"
- "I'm not good enough"
- "No plan B means I'm desperate"
- "I feel like a fraud"

### **NEW THINKING:**
- "I have my own path"
- "I'm qualified because I've been there"
- "No plan B means I'm committed"
- "Feeling like fraud = caring deeply"

## 🔥 **WHEN I DOUBT (AND I WILL):**

**Read this:**

The doubt is my default mode.

It will always be there.

That's okay.

I don't need to overcome it to do the work.

I just need to do the work DESPITE it.

That's the actual transformation.

That's what I'm teaching men.

By doing it myself.

---

## 💡 **MY COMMITMENT:**

**I will:**
- Post consistently (batch Sunday, post daily)
- Message men directly (10 per week minimum)
- Help whoever shows up
- Charge what I'm worth
- Do it MY way
- Not compare to others
- Keep going despite doubt

**I will NOT:**
- Try to go viral
- Chase $100k/month
- Force content I hate
- Give up when it gets hard
- Compare to other mentors
- Wait until I "feel ready"

---

## ✅ **THIS IS MY WAY:**

Simple videos about pain.

Direct conversations with men.

Deep transformational work.

Sustainable routine.

My path, not theirs.

**No plan B.**

**Let's go.** 🔥
