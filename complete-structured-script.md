## CAPTION SCRIPT

**"The biggest lie men tell: 'I'm fine.'**

**You know it's a lie. But you keep saying it. Every single day.**

**This was my go-to once. I said it to convince others. And myself. To keep you away from me. To stay safe. To stay stuck.**

**This is what I did: I felt something. I didn't want to deal with it. So I said 'I'm fine.' I pushed it down. I numbed it out. I pretended it wasn't there. But it was there. And it was killing me.**

**The truth is: You're not fine. You're struggling. You're lonely. You're scared. You're lost. And that's okay. It's human. It's real.**

**But here's the thing: You don't have to stay stuck. You don't have to keep lying. You can be honest. You can be real. You can be human. The workbook shows you how.**

**So I ask you: Are you ready to stop lying? Are you ready to be real? Are you ready to be human?**

**October 10th. The workbook is coming. Are you ready?**
