# Sample Instagram Post: "The Performance Never Stops"

## ðŸ“± **Instagram Post**

**Caption:**
```
I was alone in my apartment, making coffee, when I caught myself performing.

Not for anyone. There was no one there.

But there I was, standing straighter, adjusting my posture, making sure I looked "confident" even though no one could see me.

That's when I realized: I'd been performing for so long, I didn't know how to stop.

You say "I'm fine" when you're drowning.
When you're breaking.
When you're lost.

But "I'm fine" isn't strength.
It's protection.
It's avoidance.
It's isolation.

Your default mode is keeping you safe.
But it's also keeping you stuck.

Because you can't heal what you won't acknowledge.
You can't grow what you won't face.
You can't change what you won't admit.

The men who break free from their default mode?

They stop saying "I'm fine."
They start saying "I'm struggling."
"I need help."
"I don't know what to do."
"I'm scared."
"I'm lost."
"I'm not okay."

That's not weakness.
That's courage.
That's the beginning of freedom.

Stop protecting your own hostage-taker.
Stop saying "I'm fine."
Start telling the truth.

Comment "ME" if you've said "I'm fine" when you weren't.
