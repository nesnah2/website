No plan B.

I have to make this work.

I have to help men.

I have to build this.

I have to succeed.

Because there's no other option.

Because this is all I can do.

Because this is who I am.

2 years.

200 posts.

200 followers.

Zero clients.

But no plan B.

I have to make this work.

I have to help men.

I have to build this.

I have to succeed.

Because there's no other option.

Because this is all I can do.

Because this is who I am.

Comment "ME" if you feel the same way.
